# Capstone-Win-Predictability
As the capstone project to our MSBA at UT Austin, we were paired with a client and acted as external consultants to solve a machine-learning related business problem. My team was assigned to a computer technology company and tasked with creating a model to predict the win/loss outcome of a contract for our client. 

The script takes the raw data we received from the client through various preprocessing steps including cleaning and dimensionality reduction before training a Random Forest Classifier to be used for prediction on Blind Test data. 

In the end, our classifier's accuracy exceeded that of their current working model, and we expect it to be implimented in multiple forms by the client in the coming months as a tool that will improve utilization for solution architects choosing which contracts are worth undertaking.
